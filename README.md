# wordGuessGame

This game generates a random word that is Austin themed for the user to guess. 

The user presses a key corresponding to a letter in the english alphabet to guess and see if that letter is in the word.

If the letter is not in the word the Letters Guessed will display that letter. 
If the letter is in the word, the letter will display in place of the underscore where the letter is in the word.

There are only 12 tries before you lose. 

If you lose your losses will go up by 1 and update on the page.
If all the letters in the word are guessed then wins will go up by 1 and update on the page.

The user will then be prompted to play again whether they win or lose.
